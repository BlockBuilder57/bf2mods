## bf2mods

Some mod code by [modeco80](https://github.com/modeco80) and [BlockBuilder57](https://github.com/BlockBuilder57) for all Xenoblade games on Switch.

Initially based off [Ether Flow](https://github.com/3096/ether) by 3096/dualie. As such, this includes a custom fork of [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline/) modified to have an architecture similar to [exlaunch](https://github.com/shadowninja108/exlaunch).


## Installation instructions (LayeredFS)

In /atmosphere/contents/<TITLE_ID>/ make a exefs directory. In there, place the latest `main` exefs version with symbols.

Latest compatible exefs versions:

| Game                         | Title ID                                       | Last Working Version   | Codename |
|------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|:---------|
| Xenoblade 2                  | 0100E95004038000<br/>(0100F3400332C000 for JP) | 2.0.0 (or Torna 1.0.0) | bf2      |
| Xenoblade 2: Torna           | 0100C9F009F7A000                               | 1.0.0 (or XB2 2.0.0)   | ira      |
| Xenoblade Definitive Edition | 0100FF500E34A000                               | All versions           | bfsw     |

Once you've done that, simply copy the main.npdm and subsdk1 files to the exefs directory.

## Usage

Documentation for using the mod can be found in the [docs](docs) directory.

## Build Instructions

- Install devKitPro with Switch development features.
- Clone this repository with `--recursive`.
- Run the following commands:

```bash
$ cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --toolchain cmake/NintendoSwitch.cmake 
$ cd build
$ make -j4
# ...
# profit?
# to build for other games, for example DE, append -DBF2MODS_CODENAME=bfsw to the cmake command
```

Once built, copy bf2mods.nso (as `subsdk1`) and main.npdm from build/ to the LayeredFS exefs directory.

For those with sys-ftpd installed, adding `-DBF2MODS_SWITCH_IP=<ip>` to the CMake command will automatically copy the files to your console when builds finish.
